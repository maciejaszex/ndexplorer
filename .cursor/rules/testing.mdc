# Testing

- **Vitest 4.x** + **happy-dom** for DOM tests
- Pragmatic — one `it()` covers a full scenario, not individual edge cases
- Mock data in `tests/utils/mocks.ts` (17 fake logs, no real data)
- Helpers in `tests/utils/` — test files contain only assertions
- All UI text must be tested for both PL and EN key parity
- Run: `npm test` (single), `npm run test:watch` (watch)
