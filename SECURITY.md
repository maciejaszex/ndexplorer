# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead, [open a private security advisory](https://github.com/maciejaszex/ndexplorer/security/advisories/new) on this repository.

## Scope

NDExplorer runs locally and proxies requests to the NextDNS API. Your API key is stored in `.env` and never exposed to the client. If you find a way it could be leaked, please report it.
